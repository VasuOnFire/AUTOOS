## 🎮 Test Your App

### 1. Visit Frontend

You'll see interactive API documentation!

### 3. Try Authentication
1. Click "Sign Up"
2. Create an account
3. Sign in
4. Start using the app!

---

## 💡 How It Works

The `render-simple.yaml` file includes:

```yaml
# All environment variables with defaults
JWT_SECRET_KEY: auto-generated by Render
DATABASE_URL: auto-connected
REDIS_URL: auto-connected
OPENAI_API_KEY: optional (works without it)
STRIPE_KEY: optional (works without it)
```

**Everything is automatic!** 🎉

---

## 🔧 Add Features Later (Optional)

Want to add real API keys later? Easy!

### Add OpenAI (for AI features)
1. Go to your backend service in Render
2. Click **"Environment"** tab
3. Find `OPENAI_API_KEY`
4. Click **"Edit"**
5. Paste your real key: `sk-...`
6. Click **"Save"**

### Add Stripe (for payments)
1. Same process as above
2. Update `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
3. Update `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

**But the app works WITHOUT these!** 🎉

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Blueprint not found"
**Solution**: 
- Make sure you're using: `VasuOnFire/AUTOOS`
- Check you selected `render-simple.yaml`

### Issue: "Build failed"
**Solution**:
- Check the build logs
- Look for red ERROR messages (ignore warnings)
- Most common: missing dependencies (we handle this)

### Issue: "Service won't start"
**Solution**:
- Wait 5-10 minutes for first deployment
- Check if database is created first
- Look at logs for specific errors

### Issue: "Frontend shows error"
**Solution**:
- Make sure backend is deployed first
- Check backend URL in frontend settings
- Try accessing backend directly: `/docs`

### Issue: "Cold start is slow"
**This is normal!** Free tier services sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity.
- First request takes 30-60 seconds
- Subsequent requests are fast
- Upgrade to paid plan ($7/mo) to remove cold starts

---

- ✅ Backend: FREE (with cold starts)
- ✅ Frontend: FREE
- ✅ Database: FREE for 90 days
- ✅ Redis: FREE for 30 days
- ✅ SSL/HTTPS: FREE forever

**Total: $0/month** 🎉

### Paid Tier (When You're Ready)
